        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Welcome to my profile page! I am Corbin Long..." width="200">
        <p>Welcome to my profile page! I am Corbin Long, a student of Web & Computer Programming as well as a
            pizza
            connoisseur who enjoys trail
            running, hiking,
            traveling, playing the electric guitar and conducting genealogical research. I am currently enrolled
            in the
            WDD 130 Web Fundamentals course where I am learning the basics of creating webpages with HTML (Hypertext
            Markup
            Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). I feel like I have learned so much about HTML and CSS
            throughout
            this course and I am grateful to be able to learn these concepts. In a way, I view
            creating
            webpages as a form of art, a very technical form that is. My favorite
            pizza is New York Style (pepperoni, plain chesse and margherita), Detroit Style Deep-Dish (pepperoni
            and
            supreme), Chicago Style Deep Dish (pepperoni and sausage) and, Neopolitan Margherita (Original Italian
            Style).
            Similar to what I said about creating webpages with HTML and CSS, making pizza is very much a form of art as
            well.
            However, pizza making, is more of a scientific form of art which is ultilized throughout the techniques and
            methods of preparing the dough to rise as well as baking it at the right temperature in proportion to the
            length of baking. The higher the temperature of the oven is, the shorter amount of time needed to bake the
            pizza will be.
