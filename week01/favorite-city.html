    <p>Dublin, or Baile Átha Cliath in the Irish Language is the largest city on the island of Ireland and the capital
        of the Republic of Ireland and is located on the east coast of Ireland in the Province of Leinster (Cúige
        Laighean in the Irish language) with the River Liffey flowing through the city
        into the Irish Sea or Muir Éireann.</p>
    <p>Dublin contains a rich abundance of history with medieval, Georgian and Victorian architure taking the form of
        castles, cathedrals, pubs,
        libraries, colleges, and bridges. Dublin Castle (built in the 13th Century), Trinity College Dublin (founded in
        1592), The Long Room (a great library located at Trinity College Dublin where the Book of Kells is reposited),
        the Custom House, the General Post Office, the
        Samuel Beckett Bridge, Temple Bar are just a few examples of the many historical sites in Dublin.
